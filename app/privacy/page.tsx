            <p className="text-text-light mb-4">
              Data on the Site are submitted by you voluntarily, and in some cases, data may be collected automatically. Some of the data collected includes information that can be reasonably used to identify you, including your first and last name, your home address and/or email, your phone number, location, etc. ("Personal Information").
            </p>
            <p className="text-text-light mb-4">
              The gathering of Personal Information from the Site is carried out in two ways:
            </p>
            <p className="text-text-light mb-4">
              Directly: for example, when you provide information to sign up for the newsletter, to receive services, or when you address various inquiries to us or fill out forms.
            </p>
            <p className="text-text-light mb-4">
              Indirectly: through the technology of the Site, such as your IP address, the pages you are viewing on this site, your operating system, and browser type.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-serif text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Reasons for Gathering Data</h2>

            <p className="text-text-light mb-4">
              We store Personal Information as needed to provide services to you, and occasionally, for a longer period, as required by law.

            <p className="text-text-light mb-4">
              Kind Consciousness Counseling Services uses Google Analytics, Google AdWords Conversion tracker, and other Google services, as well as HubSpot, that place cookies on a browser across the website.

              Notwithstanding the above, it is possible we will transfer Personal Information to our service providers, some of whom are outside of the U.S., including jurisdictions that do not provide the same level of protection of personal information as provided in the U.S., and you agree to such transfers, as may be required. In this case, we make sure your Personal Information will be adequately protected, in accordance with the law and our internal policies.
            </p>
            <p className="text-text-light mb-4">

              CASL-Compliant Consent Forms: Consent is necessary for us to use personal information to send a CEM. Consent must be "expressed," but in certain circumstances can be "implied."
